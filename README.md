This project involves the seamless integration of SQL, Python with Pandas, and Visual Basic .NET to automate data analysis processes. 
The pipeline begins with the creation of a SQL table, followed by the extraction of data into an Excel file using Python's Pandas library. 
The final step involves leveraging a Visual Basic .NET file to generate a pivot table in Excel using the extracted data. 
This end-to-end solution streamlines the data analysis workflow, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in data processing and visualization.
